## What is this?
This is my personal project that I have worked on to learn Computer Graphics using OpenGL and GUI using dear ImGui.

## Is this useful?
No this is a hobby project that is mostly related to my learning, everything that I have written there is purely for learning.

## What technologies did you exactly work with?
I worked with the following:
1. **GLFW + GLAD** (Core OpenGL and window functionality)
2. **GLM** (For any and every math operations, except the simple ones xD)
3. **STB** (Image and texture loading)
4. **ImGui** (For GUI)
5. **Assimp** (Model loading and mesh processing)
6. **nlohmann-json** (For JSON processing)
7. **Spdlog** (For logging)

## Did you find it difficult?
Well like every other human, I find computer graphics difficult because of all the maths in it but fortunately I was able to progress way more in 2 weeks and though I find math difficult, I still love it (my favorite subject along with physics).

## What concepts did you learn?
I learned in the following:
1. Opengl itself, what is it.
2. GPU pipeline, all the steps in it.
4. Vertex and Fragment shader.
5. Vertices and indices followed by the hello world triangle.
6. Coordinate systems (NDC, world matrix, view matrix, projection matrix).
7. Camera and maths related to it.
8. Mathematics of light (Point, Spot and Directional light).
9. Material as well (I may need to revise this topic).
10. Loading models using Assimp.

## What's remaining?
Need to cover the following:
- [ ] Shadows.
- [ ] Cube maps.
- [ ] Advanced lighting (AO - Ambient Occlusion, SSAO - Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, HDR - High Dynamic Range, PBR - Physically Based Rendering).
- [ ] Deferred Rendering.
- [ ] Acceleration Structures.
- [ ] Some research papers or articles on optimization techniques.
- [ ] More shader programming.
- [ ] ECS (Entity Component System)

## What will you do after this is done?
I am planning to cover Vulkan or DX12. The choice depends on if physical books are available where I live and if my GPU can support these.

## The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
**Good**: everything I have learned so far and what's to come next. Love this subject
**Bad**: my habit of over thinking things and eventually making them a little complex.
**Ugly**: my code

## You have reached the end.
